## TODO
 
- respect current user timezone while storing and displaying dates 
- extract dimens for layout
- validate user input in edit texts
- define a separate BootUI entity and show a full list of boots (i.e. via the RecyclerView)
- manual DI could be replaced by a framework
- subscribe UI for data updates
- support notifications for prior 24 (O) Android versions
- setup and use AlarmManager for precise wake-ups and notification emit
- setup a manager for instructions on how to render notifications
- cover everything with unit tests (MockK, Espresso)
